# Learning Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework is a data access technology of choice for .NET and ASP.NET data-oriented development. .NET developers appreciate how this object-relational mapper reduces the need for writing data-access code by providing the ability to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. How can you take advantage of this framework in your programming efforts? Reynold Adolphe shows you how in this course. Reynald demonstrates how to write code-based models and how to interact with data. He also explains how Entity Framework works with ASP.NET Core MVC and Web APIs. He covers creating a console app, creating an MVC app, and more.
